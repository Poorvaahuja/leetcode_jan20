## Q1 sum of subarray minimums
Given an array of integers arr, find the sum of min(b), where b ranges over every (contiguous) subarray of arr. Since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo 109 + 7.

## Q2 find the subsequence of length k with larget sum
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You want to find a subsequence of nums of length k that has the largest sum.
Return any such subsequence as an integer array of length k.
A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Q3 K-diff pairs in an array
Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the number of unique k-diff pairs in the array.
A k-diff pair is an integer pair (nums[i], nums[j]), where the following are true:
0 <= i, j < nums.length
i != j
|nums[i] - nums[j]| == k
Notice that |val| denotes the absolute value of val.
